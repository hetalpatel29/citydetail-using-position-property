                    <p>Vadodara lies on the bank of Vishwamitri River, 141 km from Gandhinagar, the state capital. The eastern part is the old city, while the western part beyond the Railway Station is the modern part of the city. Vadodara came into prominence
                        during the period of the Maratha confederacy, when the a general of the Marathas, Pilaji Gaekwad, conquered the city from the Mughals. He and his descendants ruled the region, initially under the vassalage of the Maratha Peshwas,
                        becoming increasingly independent as the Peshwas weakened as a power. After the defeat of the Peshwas, the Gaekwads continued to rule the kingdom as one of the autonomous princely states under the British. Vadodara owes much to
                        the Gaekwads, who were generally considered to be enlightened rulers, bringing industry and excellent educational institutions to the city. Many of the attractions for travelers are from those times. The city has continued its
                        tradition of being a being an industrial centre during modern times as well. It is home to people who have moved here from other cities in India, attracted by a lifestyle that combines the calm of a small town with the amenities
                        you would expect from a major city. Vadodara has a significant population of people who have returned from a stay abroad (former Non-Resident Indians or NRIs) who have decided to settle here.</p>

                    <p>Ahmedabad is the most populous city in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court. Ahmedabad's population of 8,253,000 (as per 2021 population-census)
                        makes it the fifth-most populous city in India,[13] and the encompassing urban agglomeration population estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventh-most populous in India. Ahmedabad is located near the banks of the Sabarmati River,[16]
                        25 km (16 mi)[17] from the capital of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, also known as its twin city.[18] Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second-largest producer of cotton in India, due
                        to which it was known as the 'Manchester of India' along with Kanpur. Ahmedabad's stock exchange (before it was shut down in 2018) was the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad. A newly built Narendra
                        Modi Stadium at Motera can accommodate 132,000 spectators, being the largest stadium in the world. The world-class Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave is currently under construction and once complete, it will be one of the
                        biggest sports centers (Sports City) in India. The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction.[19] Ahmedabad's
                        increasing population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries resulting in development of skyscrapers.[20] In 2010, Ahmedabad was ranked third in Forbes's list of fastest growing cities of the decade.[21]
                        In 2012, The Times of India chose Ahmedabad as India's best city to live in.[22]The gross domestic product of Ahmedabad metro was estimated at $80 billion in 2020.[23][24] In 2020, Ahmedabad was ranked as the third-best city in
                        India to live by the Ease of Living Index.[25] Ahmedabad has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under Government of India's flagship Smart Cities Mission.[26] In July 2017, the Historic
                        City of Ahmedabad, or Old Ahmedabad, was declared an UNESCO World Heritage City</p>

                    <p>The city of Surat has glorious history that dates back to 300 BC. The origin of the city can be traced to the old Hindu town of Suryapur during 1500 – 1520 A.D., which was later colonised by the Brigus or the King from Sauvira on the
                        banks of River Tapi. In 1759, The British rulers took its control from the Mughals till the beginning of the 20th century. The city is located on the River Tapi and has about 6 km long coastal belt along the Arabian Sea. Due to
                        these reasons, the city emerged as an important trade centre and enjoyed prosperity through sea trade in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Surat became the most important trade link between India and many other countries and was
                        at the height of prosperity till the rise of Bombay port in the 17th and 18th centuries. Surat was also a flourishing centre for ship building activities. The whole coast of Tapi from Athwalines to Dumas was specially meant for
                        ship builders who were usually Rassis. After the rise of the port at Bombay, Surat faced a severe blow and its ship building industry also declined. During the post-independence period, Surat has experienced considerable growth
                        in industrial activities (especially textiles) along with trading activities. Concentration of these activities combined with residential developments has resulted in considerable expansion of the city limits</p>

                    <p>As mentioned in poet Mr.Narsinh Mehta’s poem that kathiawad be a land of god, holy saints, which is importantly a part of Mahatma Gandhi’s nation, is a famous place for the king of the jungle as well in Gir throughout asia, whose giant
                        roar brings a thrill to anyone who listens to it. Rajkot city was founded by Thakorji Vibhaji in the year of 1610 and he ruled about 282 square miles area with 64 villages throughout. In 1720 the deputy subehdar Masum Khan belonging
                        to Sorath regiment defeated the ruler and the name of Rajkot was changed to Masumabad. After that in the year of 1732 the son of the deafeated ruler Meramanji took the revenge of his father’s defeat by defeating Masum Khan again
                        and kept its name Rajkot again In the year of 1822 the British rule established an agency and kept its name Kathiawad agency. The present Kothi area which houses the customs and railway offices used to house the officials of that
                        british agency during that period. During various changes there was a change in the leadership and again the whole area belonged to the agency which is at present the Sadar area Rajkot was linked with Wankaner through railways
                        in the year 1889. In 1893 rail link was established between Rajkot and Jetalsar. During that time mostly meter gauge trains were used and which formed the main lifeline of the transport within the areas. Due to meet the water needs
                        of the Rajkot city which is built on the shore of the river Aaji a new lake called Lalpari was established in the year of 1895. In 1921 the political leadership of the Kathiawad first met in Rajkot. And during this time Lakhaji
                        Raj represented the first meet and established the first settlement of the political leadership in the area. In 1925 Mahatma Gandhi for the first time visited the city and thereby established the first educational activities. Today
                        it is a well established centre for rural industries. In 1937 Vadhera started a wide agitation again the atrocities of Diwan Viravada and thereby started the first satyagrah. And this was finally resolved by Sardar Vallabh bhai
                        Patel. This resolution was finally let down at a later stage and with this development Mahatma Gandhi started the hunger strike to denounce this move. 1942 quit India movement was also a major contributor for Rajkot to become a
                        major hub for the developments as well.</p>

                    <p>During pre-independence era, Bhavnagar was the main and the largest state in the region erstwhile known as Gohilwad. Maharaja Bhavsinghji founded state of Bhavnagar near Vadava village in 1743. As per the Hindu calendar, the day Bhavnagar
                        was founded was the third of vaishakh. The erstwhile princely states of Palitana and Vallabhipur are now a part of the district. Maharaja Shree Krishnakumar Sinhji was the first king to merge his state with the union of India,
                        at the behest of Shree Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The Gohil Rajput of the Suryavanshi clan faced severe competition in Marwar. Around 1260 AD, they moved down to the Gujarat coast and established three capitals: Sejakpur (now Ranpur),
                        Umrala, and Sihor.[2] Sejakpur was founded in 1194. In 1722–1723, the forces led by Khanthaji Kadani and Pilaji Gaekwad attempted to raid Sihor but were repelled by Maharajah Bhavsinhji Gohil. After the war, Bhavsinhji realized
                        the reason for repeated attack was the location of Sihor. In 1723, he established a new capital near Vadva village, 20 km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself. It was a carefully chosen strategic location because
                        of its potential for maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became a British protectorate. The old town of Bhavnagar was a fortified town with gates leading to other
                        important regional towns. It remained a major port for almost two centuries, trading commodities with Mozambique, Zanzibar, Singapore, and the Persian Gulf. Bhavsinhji ensured that Bhavnagar benefited from the revenue that was
                        brought in from maritime trade, which was monopolized by Surat and Cambay. As the castle of Surat was under the control of the Sidis of Janjira, Bhavsinhji brokered an agreement with them, giving the Sidis 1.25% of the revenue
                        by Bhavnagar port. Bhavsinhji entered into a similar agreement with the British when they took over Surat in 1856. Whilst Bhavsinhji was in power, Bhavnagar grew from a small chieftainship to a considerably important state. This
                        was due to the addition of new territories as well as the income provided by maritime trade. Bhavsinhji’s successors continued to encourage maritime trade through Bhavnagar port, recognizing its importance to the state. The territory
                        was further expanded by Bhavsinhji’s grandson, Vakhatsinhji Gohil, when he took possession of lands belonging to Kolis and Kathis, obtained Rajula from the Navab Saheb Ahmad Khan, and merged Ghogha Taluka into the state. In 1793,
                        Vakhatsinhji conquered the forts of Chital and Talaja, and later conquered Mahuva, Kundla, Trapaj, Umrala and Botad. Bhavnagar remained the main port of the state, with Mahuva and Ghogha also becoming important ports. Because of
                        the maritime trade, the state prospered compared to other states. During the late 19th century, the Bhavnagar State Railway was constructed. This made Bhavnagar the first state that was able to construct its railway system without
                        any aid from the central government, which was mentioned in The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Mr. Peile, a political agent, described the state as follows: “With flourishing finances and much good work in progress. Of financial
                        matters I need say little; you have no debts, and your treasury is full.”[5] Between 1870 and 1878, the state were put under joint administration, due to the fact that Prince Takhtsinhji was a minor. This period produced some notable
                        reforms in the areas of administration, revenue collection, judiciary, the post and telegraph services, and economic policy. The ports were also modernized. The two people who were responsible for those reforms were E. H. Percival
                        of the Bombay Civil Service and Gaurishankar Udayshankar Oza, Chief Minister of Bhavnagar State Bhavnagar Boroz.In 1911, HH Maharani Nundkanvarba of Bhavnagar was awarded the Order of the Crown of India, the highest Imperial award
                        for women of the Empire. The former princely state of Bhavnagar was also known as Gohilwad, “Land of the Gohils” (the clan of the ruling family)</p>
